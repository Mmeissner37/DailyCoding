      <div class="text">In a shocking display of holiday spirit, Santa was seen flying over smalltown Winchester, VA on Christmas Eve. There has a been a recent, and oftentimes heated, debate about whether or not the jolly holidy maker actually exists. Those arguments are now forever laid to rest after hundreds of witnesses spotted the white-haired man, in his festive red attire, sitting in a sleigh pulled by eight beautiful reindeer.</div>
      <div class="text">Santa waved to the rapidly gathering audience as he hovered over the downtown tree lighting ceremony. Some onlookers even swore he winked at them with a sparkle in his eye. More than a dozen women swooned. After seeming to pose for pictures, he gave his reindeer a click of his tongue and off he went. As he disappeared from sight, his jolly voice was heard saying, "Merry Christmas to all! And to all, a good night!"</div>
